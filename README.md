You can access the dataset via the following link:

The file named "yolo_blood_cell_20_5_2022.ipynb" is performed using Google colab.

Also, you have to upload the dataset on your repository of robflow.

I have divided the dataset inside robflow to 80 images for training and 20 images for validation and then I have applied the matching every anntation to its image by uploading the annotations file to robflow project.

You can track every step inside the file "yolo_blood_cell_20_5_2022.ipynb" after uploading it to Google Colab.
